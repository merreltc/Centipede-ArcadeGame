Documentation is not complete.  We did not budget enough time for this.

• Levels loading from files
Approx Work Time: 1/2 hour
Report:
Loading levels from a text file was simple, butgetting the program to delete the previous one before
loading a new one was more difficult

• Mushrooms that the player cannot move through
Approx Work Time: 1 1/2 hours
Report:
Finding the correct conditions to register a collision took time, but them we had to implement
directional collision detection so this took longer than expected
There is still a persistent bug where you cannot move along the edge of a mushroom, only away from it.

• A hero that can move and fire 1 kind of gun
Approx Work Time: 2 1/2 hours
Report:
Code was borrowed from previous projects to display hero and bullets as well as update their position
according to time.
This allowed for an easier time in implementing both the hero and the gun.
The gun does not have any collision detectors because that was not specified in this cycle and we did
not have enough time to implement that once the gun was working.

• Switching between loaded levels with U and D
Approx Work Time: 2 hours 
Report: Implementing a KeyListener to change levels presented several problems which are inherent to
KeyListeners.
