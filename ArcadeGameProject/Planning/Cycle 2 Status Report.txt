Centipede still has a weird bug where it tunnels through vertical mushroom stacks.

Documentation still not complete.

• Classic centipede monster, with classic motion
Approx Work Time: Ouch... rather not record but easily 4 days worth of time
Report: Original collision detection methods were not working, so they were changed.
Got centipede working/moving as a single head, then implemented an add head method.

• Killing the hero
Approx Work Time: 20 minutes
Report: Had an issue where I forgot to use the getClass method to check the type of entity
the player was colliding with.  Also had to add an if-statement that allows centipede to move through
player to allow collision.

• Killing the centipede
Approx Work Time: 2 hours
Report: We had some trouble with the splitting of the centipede.  We decided to make
a new class to represent centipede segments and a centipede class to hold those
segments. 

• Destroying the mushrooms
Approx Work Time: 1 Hour
Report: Originally had an issue where bullet was killed before doing damage to mushroom
or bullet was not killed and instagibbed all mushrooms in its path, fixed by checking whether
the bullet should die the tick after checking its collision
We're going to implement a better way to show they've lost health later. Probably if
we have time to make them images.
